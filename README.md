# GIF-Search

This Project uses technologies such as:  AJAX, HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap4), JAVASCRIPT (JQUERY).

*Can be used by anyone that wants the top 10 results from a GIF API.*

**After user searches a term, AJAX runs a "GET" request from an GIF API
Retrieves that data and dynimacally renders it on screen for the user to enjoy.**
