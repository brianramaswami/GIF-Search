# GIF-Search

This Project uses technologies such as:  AJAX, HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap4), JAVASCRIPT (JQUERY).

*Can be used by anyone that wants the top 10 results from a GIF API.*

**After user searches a term, AJAX runs a "GET" request. The GIF API
 then retrieves that data and dynimacally renders it on screen for the user to enjoy.**

**Feel free to clone the repository for yourself or visit the github page at : https://brianramaswami.github.io/GIF-Search/.**
