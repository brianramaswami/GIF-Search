# GIF-Search

This Project uses technologies such as:  AJAX, HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap4), JAVASCRIPT (JQUERY).

*Can be used by anyone that wants the top 10 results from a GIF API.*

**After user searches a term, AJAX runs a "GET" request. 
The GIF API then retrieves that data and returns a JSON object. 
Which is then parsed for relevant infromation. 
Then we dynamically render HTML elements on the screen to display the data for the user to enjoy.**
